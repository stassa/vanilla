%!	erase_program_clauses(-Clause_References) is det.
%
%	Erase a list of Clause_References from the dynamic database.
%
%	Clause_References is meant to be a list of references of a
%	program's clauses asserted to the dynamic database with
%	assert_program/3.
%
%	The purpose of this predicate is to allow a set of clauses
%	previously asserted by invoking assert_program/3 to be removed
%	from the dynamic database without stumbling over module scoping
%	that can be complicated when a predicate is declared in one
%	module and then clauses of it are added in another module.
%
%	For example, the following is what you should expect to see in
%	the dynamic database after a theory of father/2 is learned and
%	asserted in the dynamic database, while there is also background
%	knowledge of father/2:
%
%	==
%	% Example copied from Thelma.
%	[debug] [1]  ?- listing(thelma:father/2).
%	:- dynamic tiny_kinship:father/2.
%
%	tiny_kinship:father(stathis, kostas).
%	tiny_kinship:father(stefanos, dora).
%	tiny_kinship:father(kostas, stassa).
%	tiny_kinship:father(A, C) :-
%	    thelma:
%	    (   father_1(A, B),
%	        parent(B, C)
%	    ).
%
%	true.
%	==
%
%	This happens whenever new clauses of a previous defined
%	predicate are asserted in a different module than the
%	predicate's original implementation module. The reason we may
%	wish to do that is to create "multiple worlds" each with
%	different definitions of a predicate. For example, Thelma, where
%	the above example is taken from, asserts a learned hypothesis to
%	the dynamic database in order to test it against the negative
%	examples. However, the clauses of the learned hypothesis can get
%	mixed up with the examples of the target predicate. This creates
%	an unholy mess that is very fiddly to manage.
%	erase_program_clauses/1 helps a little, but, ultimately, one
%	must never forget that the dynamic database is evil.

%
%	Collect all clauses of a program and its Closure.
%
%	As program/3, but also collects the definitions of programs in
%	the closure of a progam.
%
%	Progam_Symbols is a list of predicate symbols and arities, F/A,
%	of clauses in a program. Closure is the set of definitions of
%	the Symbols in Program_Symbols, and the definitions of the
%	programs in the closure of each program in Program_Symbols.
%
%	Module is the definition module of each program in Closure, or
%	a module importing that module. To ensure each program in
%	Closure is accessible the best thing to do is to export
%	everything to the user module.
%
%	Example
%	-------
%	==
%	?- closure([ancestor/2],user,_Cs),forall(member(P,_Cs),print_clauses(P)).
%
%	ancestor(A,B):-parent(A,B).
%	ancestor(A,B):-parent(A,C),ancestor(C,B).

%	mother(alexandra,kostas).

%	true.

%	@tbd Why is closure/3 returning a list of lists rather than a
%	flat list? In mil_problem:encapsulated_bk/2 it's flattened after
%	being called. Why do we need to do that?
