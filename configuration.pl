%!      encapsulation_predicate(+Symbol) is semidet.
%
%       The Symbol used in encapsulation predicates.
%
%       Symbol is an atom used as the symbol of encapsulated literals in
%       clauses of examples, background knowledge, metarules and
%       invented predicates, alike.
%
encapsulation_predicate(m).


%!      example_clauses(?What) is semidet.
%
%       What to do with example clauses.
%
%       This option determines how Vanilla treats examples that are
%       given as definite clauses with one or more body literals (rather
%       than ground atoms), i.e. "example clauses".
%
%       What is one of [bind,call].
%
%       If What is "bind", example clauses are bound to each instance of
%       a metarule where that is possible.
%
%       If What is "call", the head literal of each example clause is
%       bound to the enapsulated head literal of a metarule, then the
%       body literals of the example clause are called. This may
%       result in the universally quantified variables in the head of
%       the clause, and so the encapsulated head literal of the
%       metarule, to be bound.
%
%       Use "bind" when you have a set of definite clauses that you want
%       to transform to instances of a metarule.
%
%       Use "call" when you want to use a set of definite clauses with
%       bodies to generate examples.
%
%example_clauses(bind).
example_clauses(call).


%!      fetch_clauses(?Whence) is semidet.
%
%       Where to fetch clauses from during meta-interpretation.
%
%       Clauses are "fetched" during meta-interpretation with Vanilla by
%       the predicate clause/7. A different clause of this predicate
%       fetches clauses from different sources and this option is used
%       to control which sources will be allowed in a learning attempt.
%
%       Whence can be any subset of: [builtins,bk,hypothesis,metarules].
%       These are interpreted as follows:
%
%       * builtins: clauses will be fetched from built-in and library
%       predicates loaded into memory. This option should be needed most
%       of the time when built-ins and library predicates are used in
%       background knowledge definitions.
%
%       * bk: clauses will be fetched from the set of clauses of the
%       definitions of predicates listed in the second argument of
%       background_knowledge/2 in the current experiment file.
%
%       * hypothesis: clauses will be fetched from the set of clauses
%       added to a hypothesis so-far. These clauses are stored in the
%       metasubstitution accumulator in prove/6 as metasubstitution
%       atoms and must be expanded to be used in a proof (this is
%       handled internally by prove/6). Enabling this setting allows
%       arbitrary recursion between clauses in the learned hypothesis
%       and all other sources where clauses are fetched from.
%
%       * metarules: clauses will be fetched from the list of metarules
%       given to prove/6. Enabling this setting allows construction of
%       new clauses by the Vanilla meta-interpreter by resolution with
%       metarules. This setting should probably never be removed
%       because without it clause construction is not possible. This
%       includes clauses of invented predicates.

%!      invented_symbol_prefix(?Prefix) is semidet.
%
%       Prefix used to form invnented predicates' symbols.
%
%       Invented predicate symbols are created automatically by
%       prepending Prefix to a number between 1, and the value of the
%       configuration option max_invented/1.
%
%       The default-ish Prefix for this concatenation is the atom
%       'inv_'. This character is also defined as a prefix operator with
%       precedence 1 and this can cause trouble in conjunction with the
%       tokenisation in SWI-Prolog. This configuration option allows the
%       user to set their own invented predicate symbol.
%
invented_symbol_prefix(inv_).


%!	metarule(?Id,?Name,?Clause) is semidet.
%
%	A named Metarule.
%
%       Metarules are second-order definite clauses without function
%       symbols other than constants, i.e. datalog. They are given as
%       part of a second-order background theory along with a set of
%       first-order definite clauses (i.e. a Prolog program). The
%       background theory is used in an SLD-refutation of a set of
%       example atoms, performed by prove/7 in Vanilla.
%
%       Metarules are second-order because they have variables in place
%       of predicate symbols of their literals. In particular, those are
%       second-order variables existentially quantified over the set of
%       predicate symbols. During Resolution, by unification, the
%       second-order variables in the metarules are bound to predicate
%       symbols in the first-order background theory, the examples, and
%       any invented predicate symbols. The result of this binding is a
%       first-order program that entails (logically implies) the refuted
%       example atoms with respect to the first-order background
%       knowledge.

%!      metarule_formatting(?How) is semidet.
%
%       How to print metarules learned with new_metarules/1.
%
%       How is one of: [quantified, user_friendly, expanded].
%
%       Option "quantified" prints metarules with quantifiers and in
%       formal notation found in the MIL literature. Use this option to
%       compare metarules with the ones in the literature, or just to
%       get a more clear explanation of a metarule.
%
%       Option "user_friendly" prints metarules in Louise's user-level,
%       and user-friendly format of metarules in experiment files. Use
%       this option when you want to copy a metarule and later paste it
%       to an experiment file. For example, this option is handy when
%       you learn metarules with TOIL and you want to reuse them in an
%       experiment file.
%
%       Option "expanded" prints metarules in Louise's internal format,
%       encapsulated and expanded, with an encapsulated metasubstitution
%       atom in the head. Use this option to inspect what Louise
%       actually sees when you declare a metarule.
%
%       Note that the metarules printed with option "expanded" cannot be
%       directly copy/pasted into an experiment file. Or, well, sure
%       they can... but they won't be picked up by experiment_data/5 and
%       you will probably see errors.
