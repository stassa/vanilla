/** <module> Predicates for subhypothesis selection.

NOTE: predicates in this module have not been maintained, or tested
carefully, for a while and might break or raise strange new errors. To
separate a Top Program to sub-programs, prefer the greedy learning
version of TPC in subsystems/greedy.pl.


Predicates in this module are used to reduce the Top program by
selecting one or more of its subsets of clauses as _subhypotheses_.

Subhypotheses selected by predicates in this module are _inductively_
irredundant, as opposed to _logically_ irredundant as the reductions of
the Top program by Plotkin's algorithm.

A clause C is inductively redundant with respect to another clause D,
iff the set of positive examples entailed by C is a subset of the set of
positive examples entailed by D.

However, note that there is no guarantee that any of the subhypotheses
selected by predicates in this module will also be _logically_
irredundant. Logical redundancy can be reduced using Plotkin's program
reduction algorithm implemented in the primary module of
lib(program_reduction).

%!	subhypotheses_dynamic(+Pos,+BK,+Hypothesis,-Subhypotheses) is
%!	nondet.
%
%	Select a Subhypothesis that is a subset of Hypothesis.
%
%	Use this predicate to generate subhypotheses from an
%	over-hypothesis (i.e. the Top program) learned by a dynamic
%	learning predicate: learn_dynamic/1, learn_dynamic/2, or
%	learn_dynamic/5.
%
%	Pos is a list of the positive examples of a MIL problem.
%
%	BK is a list of predicate symbols and arities of the background
%	knowledge in the MIL problem.
%
%	Hypothesis is a hypothesis learned for the MIL problem.
%	Normally, Hypothesis should be the Top program for the MIL
%	problem, but it could also be already reduced (e.g. by Plotkin's
%	algorithm). Hypothesis may include invented predicates.
%
%	Subhypothesis is a list of clauses that is a subset of
%	Hypothesis and such that no clauses in Subhypothesis are
%	inductively redundant with respect to each other.
%
%	Like subhypothesis/4 this predicate uses setup_call_cleanup/3 to
%	ensure the positive examples and background knowledge are
%	written to the dynamic database before subhypothesis selection,
%	and that they are removed after the last successful result.
%
%	Additionally this predicate writes the _hypothesis_ to the
%	database, including any invented predicates. Predicates learned
%	dynamically may have dependent clauses, including recursive
%	clauses, in which case their call targets must be in the program
%	database for subhypothesis selection to correctly find the set
%	of examples entailed by each clause.
