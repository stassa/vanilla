%!      clause_limit(?Limit) is semidet.
%
%       Limit the number of resolving clauses learned from each example.

%       Limit should be a natural number, including 0, or the atom 'inf'
%       representing positive infinity if a limit is not required.

%!      listing_limit(?Limit) is semidet.
%
%       Limit the clauses printed when a MIL problem is listed.
%
%       Limit is a number, limiting the number of clauses of examples
%       and BK that will be printed to the output when a MIL problem is
%       listed. Affects list_mil_problem/1 and
%       list_encapsulated_problem/1.
%
%       Limit should be a positive integer. It can also be the atom
%       'inf' representing positive infinity. If Limit is 'inf', then no
%       limit is imposed on the printed information.

%!	recursive_reduction(?Bool) is semidet.
%
%	Whether to reduce the Top program recursively or not.
%
%	Setting Bool to true enables recursie reduction of the Top
%	program. Recursive reduction means that the result of each
%	reduction step is given as input to the reduction algorithm in
%	the next step (also known as "doing the feedbacksies").
%
%	Recursive reduction can result in a stronger reduction in less
%	time, with a lower setting for resolutions/1 (in fact, the same
%	amount of reduction can take less time exactly because the
%	resolutions/1 setting can be set to a lower value).
%
%	Recursive reduction is more useful when the Top program is large
%	and many resolution steps are required to remove all redundancy
%	from it.
%
recursive_reduction(false).
%recursive_reduction(true).


%!	reduction(?Method) is semidet.
%
%	Select a Method for Top program reduction.
%
%	One of:
%	* none: no reduction.
%	* plotkins: discard logically redundant clauses by application
%	of Plotkin's program reduction.
%	* subhypothesis: select one hypothesis entailed by the Top
%	program.

%!      tautology(+Clause) is det.
%
%       True when Clause is a tautology.
%
%       This configuration option formalises the concept of a
%       tautological clause as it is used in Poker. In short, a clause
%       is a tautology if it is a definite clause with one or more body
%       literals and all its literals are identical.
%
%       For example, the following clause is considered to be a
%       tautology:
%       ==
%       p(A,B):- p(A,B), p(A,B)
%       ==
%
%       Whereas the following clauses are not considered to be
%       tautologies:
%       ==
%       p(a,b)
%       p(A,B):- p(B,A)
%       ==
%
%       And so on. Formalising the concept of tautology in Poker is
%       useful because of the way the Top Proram Construction (TPC)
%       algorithm works. TPC adds to the background knowledge the set of
%       positive examples, which then functions as an extensional,
%       partial definition of each target predicate. TPC then
%       generalises each example to a clause that entails the example
%       with respect to the background knowledge. Since the background
%       knowledge includes each positive example, it is possible and in
%       fact common to end up with clauses generalising an example by
%       creating an implication of an atom of the example's predicate by
%       one or more instances of itself. For example, if p(a,b) is a
%       positive example, p(A,B):- p(A,B) is a clause tautologically
%       expressing the fact that each atom of p/2 entails itself.
%
%       Such tautologies are removed from the Top program by Plotkin's
%       program reduction algorithm since they are always entailed by
%       the rest of the Top program (and by anything else, ever really).
%       However, alternative reduction methods, such as subhypothesis
%       selection or minimal program learning do not rely on entailment
%       of a clause by the rest of the program and so may not be able to
%       get rid of tautologies as simply as Plotkin's reduction. For
%       such reduction methods, a tautology check is needed. This
%       predicate forms the basis of such a check.
%
%       Note that tautological clause generally only arise when the
%       Identity metarule, or one of its specialisations is in the set
%       of metarules for a MIL problem. The Identity metarule is P(x,y)
%       :- Q(x,y) where {P,Q} are second-order existentially quantified
%       variables that are not constrainted to be different. If P = Q
%       then the resulting clause is a tautology, but this is not always
%       the case, so Identity is generally useful (in fact,
%       indispensible, given that it represents one third of the
%       properties necessary to construct an equivalence relation). A
%       specialisation of Identity is a metarule with multiple clauses
%       having identical literals up to renaming of their second order
%       existentially quantified variables, for example the following is
%       a specialisation of Identity: P(x,y):- Q(x,y), R(x,y) and if P =
%       Q = R the resulting clause would be a tautology as defined by
%       this predicate.
